💎 Diamond Price Prediction App
This is a Streamlit web application that predicts the price of a diamond based on its features such as carat, cut, color, clarity, and dimensions (x, y, z). The model is trained using the Random Forest Regressor from scikit-learn and uses the popular diamonds.csv dataset.

📌 Features

Interactive sidebar input for diamond features.

Displays predicted price in real-time.

Scatter plot visualization of carat vs price colored by cut.

Automatically handles missing data with mean imputation.

Supports custom user input through a Streamlit UI.
